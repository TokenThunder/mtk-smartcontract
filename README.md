The source code of the moya token smart contract based on the ERC20 standard.

# Introduction
The internet’s largest and most important — and yet unsung — champions are the privately-owned submarine cables that orbit the Earth. Land links between cities and cables that run alongside roads and into houses and offices are certainly impressive — and without them we wouldn’t have an internet! — but sinking a cable into the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and even Arctic Oceans requires a billion-dollar logistical feat that requires years to enact. The Africa Coast to Europe Submarine ("ACE") cable began deployment in 2009 in its quest to build a submarine cable 17,000 Kms from Europe to Africa. Moya will connect the ACE capacity form South Africa and distribute its capacity throughout Southern Africa via its Backhaul Networks.
